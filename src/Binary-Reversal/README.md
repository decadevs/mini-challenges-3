## Binary Reversal

Have the function BinaryReversal(str) take the str parameter being passed, which will be a positive integer, take its binary representation (padded to the nearest N * 8 bits), reverse that string of bits, and then finally return the new reversed string in decimal form. For example: if str is "47" then the binary version of this integer is 101111 but we pad it to be 00101111. Your program should reverse this binary string which then becomes: 11110100 and then finally return the decimal version of this string, which is 244.

**Input: "213"**
**Output: 171**
 
**Input: "4567"**
**Output: 60296**
